/Theory1: Conflicting selectors and declarations

there are multiple selectors selecting the same element. Which one of them applies? => all rules are applied

* BLOCK-LEVEL ELEMENTS
	- Elements are formatted visually as blocks
	- Elements occupy 100% of parent elements's width, no matter the content
	- Elements are stacked vertically by default, one after another
	- The box-model applies as showed earlier
default elements: body, main, header, footer, section , nav, aside, div, h1-H6, p, ul, ol, li, etc.
with CSS: display: block
* INLINE ELEMENT
	- Occupies only the space necessary for its contents
	- Causes no-line-breaks after or before the element
	- Box model applies in a different way: heights and widths do not apply
	- Paddings and margins are applied only horizontally
default elements: a, strong, em, button, etc
width CSS: display: inline
* INLINE-BLOCk ELEMENT: look like INLINE-LEVEL outside, behaves like BLOCK_LEVEL on the inside
	- Occupies only the space necessary for its contents
	- Causes no-line-breaks after or before the element
	- The box-model applies as showed earlier
